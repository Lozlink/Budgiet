## About :rocket:

Budgiet is a project that came to fruition with analyzing the trends around the world. With the rising cost of everyday household items, budgeting has never been more important for Households. Budgiet provides a way for you to keep track of your income and expenses and maintain financial literacy.

## Technology used

React- Budgiet uses the React framework to power its front-end. This results in a seamless experience for the user, and an easy opportunity for anyone to understand the routing of the code, given they have experience with the usability of the React framework. The React implementation allowed for greater flexibility in providing the front-end and allowed me to understandd the framework better.

Express/node.js/postgresql- Budgiet utilizes a persisting database to store it's content in which express provides the back end component of this project. The ability to utilize the express framework married with React provided exposure in how a full stack with two different frameworks operates and the importance of the moving parts. 


### Modules used:
React Modules:
- `Axios`
- `React-router-dom`
- `Sass`
- `Redux (Under Construction)`

Express Modules:
- `dotemv`
- `express-session`
- `pg`
- `bcrypt`
- `nodemon`

## Approach Taken & Planning:

### Approach:
I knew from the get go, that I was going to implement React as my front-end to gain a deeper understanding of the framework. Initially, I thought about utilizing a front-end app exclusively, but I figured the idea of creating a full stack application would give me a better understanding of all the moving parts that comes with it.  

Upon starting to develop the project, I was able to understand the difficulty of the task and it provided me with insight in terms of the importance of being able to understand the code's journey to even get a single desired output. I learned new concepts, attempted to implement new technology(albeit unsuccesfully for redux) and ultimately felt like it pushed my knowledge.
